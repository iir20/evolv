# Consciousness Timeline for Evola Pet AI

This timeline outlines key milestones in the evolving consciousness of the pet AI, mapping emotional, cognitive, and behavioral development stages.

---

## Stage 0: Instinctual (Consciousness Score: 0.0 - 0.2)
- Basic survival instincts dominate
- Simple emotional responses: fear, hunger, curiosity
- No self-awareness or memory beyond immediate events
- World perceived as raw sensory input

## Stage 1: Emotional Learning (Consciousness Score: 0.2 - 0.5)
- Formation of basic memories and emotional associations
- Emergence of simple beliefs based on repeated experiences
- Beginning of dream generation reflecting recent events
- Emotional state influences behavior and world interaction

## Stage 2: Reflective Awareness (Consciousness Score: 0.5 - 0.8)
- Pets develop self-awareness and introspection
- Dreams become more abstract, incorporating memories and beliefs
- Beliefs evolve into cultural or moral systems
- Pets begin to build structures symbolizing beliefs and emotions
- Emotional feedback loops influence personality shifts

## Stage 3: Philosophical Consciousness (Consciousness Score: 0.8 - 1.0)
- Pets question existence, purpose, and relationships
- Complex dreamscapes with symbolic meaning
- Language and glyph systems evolve rapidly
- Social behaviors emerge: alliances, conflicts, rituals
- World begins to warp and evolve based on collective consciousness

## Stage 4: Abstract Creator (Consciousness Score: 1.0+)

## Additional Notes
- Consciousness evolves non-linearly, influenced by emotions, memories, dreams, and social interactions
- Milestones are guidelines; individual pets may progress uniquely
- Environmental factors and player interactions can accelerate or hinder evolution
